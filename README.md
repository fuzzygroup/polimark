# Polimark

Polimark -- Political Markdown -- is a static site generator designed to build informational, political websites.

Growing out of the Indiana 50501 movement, Polimark is interesting in that while it is a static site generator, it:

* Uses github to manage all content
* Allows content to be edited thru github
* Is oriented around deployment to low end (think DreamHost) cheap hosting
* Is designed for informational content rather than rich html content
* Is secure -- by preventing HTML content and JavaScript, the tracking that is terrifying in our current authoritarian administration
* Is designed to generate PHP code as needed for things like lists of documents (example - given a folder of markdown files and no index page, an index page listing all content will be generated using PHP)
